# Claude Code Guidelines

## Diff Optimization
- **Minimal changes only**: Change only lines directly required for the task
- **Avoid unrelated modifications**: Don't alter existing code that works correctly
- **Optimize for review**: Every changed line adds cognitive load for reviewers

## Plans

All changes have plans which are present in the `plan` directory as markdown files with names `${RFC-3339 Time Stamp}-${Summary}.md`.
